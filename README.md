A maintained fork of `candyscript` by @benob https://github.com/benob/candyscript

## Features

* Line-by-line parser
* One of the fastest web server powered by Nim's `asynchttpserver`
* Short and efficient
* No external database service required.
* < 85 lines of Nim code!
* A single binary for everything

## TODO

* [ ] Add backend integration with other languages
* [ ] Add multiple database integration
* [ ] Use `httpbeast` instead of `asynchttpserver`

## Example

### Hello, World!

```yaml
# this is a comment
GET "/": Hello, World!
```

## Building from source

Use the Nim compiler [nim](https://nim-lang.org) to compile the Bloom source code.

This code will run your candyscript server.
```bash
nim c index.nim
./index your_script.candy
```
